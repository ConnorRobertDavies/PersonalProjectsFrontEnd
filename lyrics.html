        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <pre>
            You're scared of a world where you're needed
            So you never made nice with the locals
            But you tied me up slow with your vine stuff
            It takes a few years, but they break bones
            It takes a few months, but our bones heal
            We're stronger, and we tell all our school friends
            And they sign our cast in the playground
            Darling, the rest of my body, it's yours, then
        </pre>
        <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
        <pre>
            I know you're scared
            Well, I'm scared too
            Oh, that every time I try to makе lunch
            For anyone else, in my hеad
            I end up dreaming of you
            And you come to me
        </pre>
        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <pre>
            Good morning
            Show me the place where he inserted the blade
            Or praise the Lord, burn my house
            I get lost, I freak out
            You come home and hold me tight
            As if it never happened at all   
        </pre>
        <h3>[Bridge]</h3>
        <pre>
            Good morning
            Show me the place where he inserted the blade
            Good morning
            Where is your light? Am I home?
            I will hold to my chest where the wind can exist
            I will try
            Not to keep you too long
        </pre>
        <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
        <pre>
            So clean your soup-maker and breathe in
            Your chicken, broccoli and everything
            The tug that's between us, that long string
            Concorde, Bound 2, and my evening
            The good hunter's guide to a bad night
            Darlin', I'll spoil it myself, thanks, you're leaving
            Well, I tried just to stroke your dreams better
            But, darlin', I see that you're not really sleeping
        </pre>
        <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
        <pre>
            I know you're scared
            Well, I'm scared too
            Oh, that every time I try to makе lunch
            For anyone else, in my hеad
            I end up dreaming of you
            And you come to me
        </pre>
        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <pre>
            Good morning
            Show me the place where he inserted the blade
            Or praise the Lord, burn my house
            I get lost, I freak out
            You come home and hold me tight
            As if it never happened at all   
        </pre>
        <h3>[Outro]</h3>
        <pre>
            Good morning
            Show me the fifth or the cadence you want me to play
            Good morning
            Show me where to tie the other end of this chain
        </pre>
